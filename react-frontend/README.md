# Requirements

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)

# Initialize

```bash
cd react-frontend
npm install
```

# Run

```bash
ionic serve
```

Open http://localhost:8100.

Ionic enables to create native apps, but right now, we only use it as a React
library.

Open `/hud` with apple vision, or /home to use camera. The `MainUIController.tsx` is the
main UI controller.
